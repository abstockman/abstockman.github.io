        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><img src="assets/images/bryce_1.jpg" alt="Bryce in Utah">My name is Bryce Stockman and this is a filler paragraph. Later, when I finish this site, this is where I will write a bunch of cool stuff about myself; like how I play guitar, love basketball, and father an adorable boxer pup. Now I am adding more to my paragraph to see what it looks it with more words. Words words words. Hopefully this is enough! If not, here is one more sentence: Coding is cool! It wasn't enough, sadly. I went to University of South Florida, which is a rival of University of Central Florida, which is where I'm attending coding bootcamp. Enough yet?</p>
        <p>This is a second paragraph to go above the first. It showed two paragraphs in the example so I'm just trying to make it look similar. I'm just adding more words now to see if my fixed nav and footer and doing their jobs correctly. I think I wrote the html right but I'm just doing this to make sure. Here is some more filler text. Lorizzle uhuh ... yih! dolor sit amizzle, tellivizzle adipiscing elit. Bling bling its fo rizzle velizzle, da bomb volutpizzle, shiz ma nizzle, get down get down vizzle, arcu. Fo shizzle eget tortor.

        <p>Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.
        <p>Capitalize on low hanging fruit to identify a ballpark value added activity to beta test. Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from DevOps. Nanotechnology immersion along the information highway will close the loop on focusing solely on the bottom line.</p>
